                <h2 class="titleText">New Design (picture next to)</h2>
                <p class="text">We currently have 3 game modes, 3 new ones will arrive in the next big update (2.1). Each game mode has its monsters and meteorites of a different color, but the design is the same !
                    <br>So I decided that in the 3.1 version of this site, 4 new designs will appear on the game! They will be applicable on the standard game mode, the code will remain the same, only the aesthetic of the game will change! There will be a mummy style, a samurai style, a knight style, and a surprise style!
                    <br>The characters you see next to them are the design of the days and not the monsters.</p>

                <p class="text">We currently have 3 game modes, standard mode, easy mode and hard mode.
                    <br>In update 2.1, the next major update, 3 or 4 new game modes will appear. There will be:
                    <br>- Super fast mode: standard mode but with increased speed
                    <br>- Sudden death mode: standard mode with a little more meteorite, at the slightest contact the player dies
                    <br>- The health plus mode: hard mode but with more life for the player... but also for the monsters!
                    <br>- The meteorite mode: there are no more monsters but more meteorites which are faster, dodge them or die!
                    <br><br>The hard+ mode will arrive with a small update between 2.1 and 3.1</p>

                <h2 class="titleText">Recap of the next big updates</h2>
                <p class="text">We are currently at version 1.1. Each large version contains 3 small versions in which the functionalities hardly change (e.g. 1.1, 1.2, 1.3).
                    <br>3 big updates are scheduled:
                    <br>- 2.1 : 3 or 4 new game modes will be released (they will be directly available in the download tab), in the 2.2 version will be released a last game mode
                    <br>-3.1 : 4 new designs will be available for download in a brand new tab "designs"!
                    <br>-4.1 : a new game in the same universe will be released... in 3D! It will be much more complex and will offer much more features than the first one which is very limited
                    <br><br>Here are the big changes to come, there will also be other small changes such as a scoreboard, a summary at the beginning of the game etc...</p>
