                <h2>about<br><text>Hacker</text><br><span>Game</span></h2>
                <p>Hacker game is a 2D game coded in Python3.10 using the "pygame" and "random" imports. The player embodies a hacker who can move laterally and can shoot projectiles to eliminate monsters. The monsters, of random speeds, inflict damage to the player on contact. Eliminating a monster adds 10 points to your score. Meteors of different speeds fall from the sky randomly, and kill the player if they come in contact with him. The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible in order to get the highest score possible. Since many factors are random, no two games are the same!</p>

                <p class="text">I'm Adrien Rivet (nickname: Blue Bear), a 17 years old high school student. I've been passionate about computers for a few years, and programming is fun for me. I would like to work in the field of cybersecurity later on, that's what interests me the most in the digital world! I'm a very beginner developer, my codes are often inspired by development tutorials available on YouTube (the list of YouTube channels I draw inspiration from is available in the "development" tab).</p>

            <h2 class="heading">My skills</h2>
            <p class="text">To carry out this project, skills are needed. The first of these is design. To create a video game and the website that goes with it, you need graphic elements. For this, I use Canva to design everything myself, sometimes using pre-existing royalty-free icons and images. The second is programming. The goal of this project was to code everything by hand, so I need programming skills, especially with Python, HTML and CSS, but also the developer way of thinking. The last one is project management. To complete a task, you need to manage many parameters such as the schedule.</p>

                <p class="text">To create a quality project, you need to use state-of-the-art technologies. Among these, there are the latest versions of programming languages like Python3.10, HTML5 and CSS3, but also development tools like Visual Studio Code or Pycharm, backup tools like Cacher or GitHub, project management tools like Notion... These are the technologies that ensure the quality of programming projects and help me to be as productive as possible.</p>

            <p class="text">You will soon be able to follow me on different social networks (they won't be personal accounts but accounts focused on my project of course). I will have YouTube and TikTok accounts where you can find gameplays, videos, trailers..... I will also have an Instagram account for announcements, news, photos, videos: it's the center of my social networks and the best to follow my game. Finally I will set up a GitHub account to share my code, I'm also making a discord server that when online will allow access to as much content as possible. (this site is only at version 1.1, the links below don't work yet, the accounts are not created but it happens in version 1.2 !)</p>

                        <p>The first source of inspiration for a developer is always his own imagination. I personally have a lot of imagination and the ideas for my projects come from my brain: I take a blank sheet of paper and write down my goals and then document them in order to achieve them.</p><br>

                        <p>But afterwards, when you have a clear idea of your objectives, the inspiration obviously comes from the Internet. There is an almost infinite amount of knowledge and documentation: I draw inspiration from blogs, tutorials, websites and YouTube videos (I detail all this in the development tab).</p><br>
