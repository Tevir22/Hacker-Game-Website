            <h2>Blue Bear development</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my developer site! I'm Adrien (my development nickname is Blue Bear) and this is my website dedicated to my video game "Hacker Game". The programming of this video game and this website is my first big development project, in Python3.10 for the game and Html5 & Css3 for the site. I usually mainly develop Python scripts with or without graphical interface, but also little websites (often only one page) or other little projects. I code all my scripts by hand (with the help of youtube videos and websites) using several programming languages like Python, Html, Css, C++ and I begin JavaScript.
                <br><br>This is the home page of the site about my game. You will find in the "Game" section the trailer of my video game, but also a detailed description of the game. It's a 2D game coded in Python thanks to the pygame import. All the graphic designs of the game were also designed by hand with Canva, from royalty-free logos from flaticon. In this section you will also find a link to see if you wish the python scripts (.py) which are the pure and hard code of my game. To execute the game YOU MUST have Python installed on your PC (this file is available for download in the "download" tab). The link will lead you to a folder containing also the graphic and sound resources of my game. You can also access 2 additional pages via game : News & Code. The News page contains teasers and information about the next maj (for example a new difficulty level with a dedicated trailer). And the Code page contains the code of my game (to copy and paste if you want or just to look at it).
                <br><br>You will find in the "Downloads" section 3 files to download corresponding to 3 levels of difficulty of my game (each level is commented). There are 3 different versions of my game (1.1 : standard level; 1.2 : easy level; 1.3 : hard level). Each version has a different shade of graphics but has the same script except the "blue values" have been changed (the "blue values" are the hard values in the code, tinted in blue in a the Python interpreter Pycharm hence their name, which determine factors such as speed, damage or living standards). If you want to create your own version of my game, you can copy my scripts from the "Game/Code" tab and change the values yourself using a Python IDE (I recommend Pycharm Comunity or VisualStudioCode) to create your own custom version.
                <br><br>In the "About" section, you'll find various information like information about me, ways to contact me, my social networks (accounts do not exist yet), my capabilities...
                <br><br>By clicking on the logo "development" on the top left of the home page, you will access to my development tools (applications) and a link repository page, leading to useful websites that I used in the realization of my project. There are also on this page my recommended YouTube channels, the codes on which I was inspired... 
                <br><br>Thank you for visiting my site, I hope you'll enjoy its content!
                <br>Site version : 1.1
